This article is about a crude magnetic levitation experiment quickly thrown together on some weekend. The purpose of the setup is to let a stack of $$10\,\mathrm{mm}$$ neodymium magnet cubes hover under an electromagnet. In order to accomplish this, a PID feedback loop has been used. The setup can be seen in the figure below. The main components are:
- [NUCLEO-L432KC](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l432kc.html) microcontroller board
- [TB6612FNG](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Robotics/TB6612FNG.pdf) H-bridge ic [breakout board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14451)
- Electromagnet
- some $$10\,\mathrm{mm}$$ neodymium magnet cubes
- [49E](https://p.globalsources.com/IMAGES/PDT/SPEC/440/K1139513440.pdf) linear Hall-effect sensor
- Breadboard
- Frame made of cardboard, sticky tape and a ballpoint pen for extra rigidity of the construction ðŸ˜…

I do not have a data sheet for the electromagnet. It has a diameter of $$40\,\mathrm{mm}$$, a hight of $$20\,\mathrm{mm}$$, and it is rated for $$12\,\mathrm{V}$$ and for holding a load of $$25\,\mathrm{kg}$$.

A simplified schematic of the setup can be seen in the figure below. The output voltage of the linear Hall-effect sensor below the stack of neodymium magnet cubes is related to the distance of these magnets from the sensor, thus providing a means of measuring the position of the magnets. The output signal of the Hall-effect sensor is feed into an ADC pin of the [NUCLEO-L432KC](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l432kc.html) microcontroller board. The microcontroller runs a PID control algorithm (more on that later). A function generator connected to another ADC pin provides the set point for the control loop. Based on the set point signal and the signal coming from the Hall-effect sensor, the microcontroller computes the voltage to be applied to the electromagnet via a PID algorithm. To actually apply the calculated voltage, the H-bridge is feed by a $$32\,\mathrm{kHz}$$ PWM signal with the corresponding duty cycle.

The transfer function of a PID controller with realization pole is given by

$$
\begin{align}
   C(s)&=\frac{u(s)}{e(s)}=P+I\frac{1}{s}+D\frac{s}{1+\tfrac{s}{\omega_0}}\,.
\end{align}
$$

(The larger $$\omega_0$$, the larger is the frequency up to which the derivative term indeed behaves like a differentiator.) For an implementation in a microcontroller, the transfer function needs to be discretized. Here, following [https://www.scilab.org/discrete-time-pid-controller-implementation](https://www.scilab.org/discrete-time-pid-controller-implementation), the [backward Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_Euler_method) has been used for the discretization. In a nutshell, we simply have to substitute $$s=\tfrac{z-1}{T_sz}$$, which yields the $$z$$-transfer function

$$
\begin{align}
   C_z(z)&=P+I\frac{T_sz}{z-1}+D\frac{\omega_0(z-1)}{(1+\omega_0 T_s)z-1}\,,
\end{align}
$$

where $$T_s$$ is the sampling time. In my setup, the control algorithm running on the microcontroller is a realization of this $$z$$-transfer function in form of a difference equation, augmented by an integrator windup protection. The control loop runs at a frequency of $$2.5\,\mathrm{kHz}$$, i.e. the sampling time is $$T_s=400\,\mathrm{\mu s}$$. 

## Experimental Results

In the video below, the function generator voltage (i.e. the set point of the control loop) has been set to a constant value. The stack of cube magnets levitates at a constant height.

Besides a constant set point, I also tried a low frequency sinusoid, which is nicely tracked. The cube magnets dangle up and down such that the voltage of the Hall-effect sensor tracks the low frequency sinusoid coming from the function generator.
